README for ToDoListFrontend

 PROJECT OVERVIEW

The To-Do List Frontend is a simple, interactive web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to register, log in, view their tasks, add new ones, mark them as completed, or delete them — all through an easy-to-use interface connected to the backend API.

 FEATURES

. User registration & login

. Dynamic task list display

. Add, mark as completed, and delete tasks

. Clean and responsive layout

. Smooth communication with the backend using fetch() API calls

KEY INSIGHTS

. The UI updates dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation — no need to reload pages.

. CSS styling keeps the interface simple, clean, and mobile-friendly.

. Backend integration ensures that all changes persist to the database in real time.

. The app is modular, making it easy to replace the backend or switch to a framework later.

CONCLUSION

The frontend offers a clean, interactive experience that works perfectly with the Spring Boot backend.
Together, they form a complete, functional To-Do Management System — simple enough for learners, but structured enough for future expansion into a full-stack project.
